Prior to the Neutral Rim War, living standards on Cera were comparable to the Solar Alliance core worlds, minus the rampant overpopulation, making it one of the jewels of the Neutral Rim.>>>>Following the tragic destruction of its capital city in the early days of the Neutral Rim War, Veniczar Fontana has funneled trillions of credits into reconstruction efforts, slowly gaining a measure of trust in Cera as a reformer. Today, New Cera City is a modern and revitalized core of technology and manufacturing thanks to the hard work of Cerans.>>>>Cera is the site of the infamous Liberation Day Massacre, where the Prototype Chigara assassinated Admiral Grey of the Solar Alliance, plunging humanity into a period of great bloodshed.

# CLASS 3 ARID WORLD>>POPULATION: 3 million>>>>Dry and scarce of creature comforts, the Neutral Rim planet of Tydaria would be omitted from most star maps if not for its rich gray iron deposits. Most Tydarians are related to the mining industry in some form. Tydarians are as rugged as the rocks which line the surface of Tydaria and possess a straightforward and humorless attitude. Tydarians are fierce merchants and will pinch every penny out of a deal.>>>>Following the Solar Alliance's rout from the Neutral Rim, PACT has established de jure control of this world. However, due to its remote and underdeveloped status, not much has changed for its inhabitants, aside for the placement of some token PACT military personnel and propaganda speakers.

The Canal is largely used by adventurous traders who deliver goods from the Denari Expanse to the Neutral Rim.>>>>However, with the Solar Alliance's heavy military presence at the gateway world of Far Port, the Ryuvia Canal has seen increased traffic from traders seeking to enter Alliance space, providing Ryuvia with an unexpected revenue source from the toll collections.
