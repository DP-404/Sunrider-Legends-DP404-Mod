# You hail from this quaint harbor town situated deep in the Neutral Banners. A sleepy village of little note, most of the villagers work as clam divers or fishers. Approximate equal proximity to Halla and the Asahi Isle has led to the intermingling of Elves and Maan. Here, they live side by side along with countless mixed Maan-Elves. Apart from the occasional pirate threat, life in Cera is largely dull and slow.

Alas, following the collapse of the Holy Ryuvian Empire, much of Ryuvia's old wonder has been lost and it now nearly the same as any other economically depressed Maan city. Over the course of centuries, Elf and Maan came to intermingle here, leading most immortal High Elves to depart for Volaris.
